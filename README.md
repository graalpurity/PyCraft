# Errors
If you find yourself with an any error(s) It's probably an error within the project itself, such a missing a reference or the project itself being broken. Some methods of fixing these could be, adding the missing references or making sure all references are updated, if these fail to fix your issue(s), try making a new windows forms project and adding the required dependencies and references to your new solution.
